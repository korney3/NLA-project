# Image Watermarking Using DWT and SVD

Final project in NLA course at Skoltech, 2018.

### Implemented functions: 


1) Haar Wavelet forward and inverse transformation of images.

2) Digital image watermark embedding and extracting. 


### Files


1) Watermarked images, distorted by Gaussian blur, Contrast, Crop, Gamma Correction, Histogram equalization, Noize, Pixelate, Rotate.

2) Watermarked images, distorted by various degree of Gaussian blur.

3) Original image, watermark image.
