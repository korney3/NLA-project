# Image Watermarking Using DWT and SVD

Final project in NLA course at Skoltech, 2018.

### Implemented functions: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Haar Wavelet forward and inverse transformation of images.
\item Digital image watermark embedding and extracting. 
\end{itemize}

### Files

\begin{itemize}
\item Watermarked images, distorted by Gaussian blur, Contrast, Crop, Gamma Correction, Histogram equalization, Noize, Pixelate, Rotate.
\item Watermarked images, distorted by various degree of Gaussian blur
\end{itemize}
